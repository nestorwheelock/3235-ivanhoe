## Notes

- Primary photo becomes hero header image
- All photos appear in carousel (ordered by display_order)
- Handle properties with 0 photos (show placeholder)
- Handle properties with 1 photo (no carousel, just display)
- Lightbox should prevent body scroll when open
- Carousel thumbnails should indicate active image
- Consider lazy loading for images (performance)
